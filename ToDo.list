Contemplate "Potion Jars" :We have these jar graphics that look nice we can use thm for the "placeable potions" or for something 
more worthwhile like the magicks so I will add them but will not add recipes.

Tonights Goal: Get ingot graphics done, Finish most current recipes [Board Recipes are Top Priority after Ingots] Add jars into
code, register everything with the lang file.


Current Known Derps: Ore Dictionary crashes the game if you add a "block" ore dictionary-> I am doing something wrong
